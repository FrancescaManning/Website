                   Hi! My name is Rose Henriksson, I go to Kungsholmens Gymnasium in Sweden and I speak English, Swedish, a little Spanish and a tiny bit of Hebrew. I am half American and half Swedish so I am a part of both cultures, but I have lived in Sweden my whole life. I am catholic, so I value morality and honesty. I was named 'Rose' after Portland, Oregon (the city of roses) and St. Rose of Lima, Per√∫. I love playing music and I am fascinated by different instruments and people ability to learn to play them.</p>

               <h3>Hobbies</h3>
               <p>I have many hobbies but some of them are:</p>
               <ul>
                   <li>Playing the violin</li><li>Rollerblading</li><li>Drawing</li><li>Crocheting</li><li>Bicycling</li><li>Making clay figures</li><li>Reading</li><li>Baking</li><li>Gardening</li>
               </ul>
               
               <p>In January I was looking around in a second-hand store when I came across a cuckoo clock. I was fascinated by how it worked using gravity instead of batteries, so I took it apart, oiled it and figured out how it works. Some crucial parts are missing that I need to order online, but hopefully it will work in the end.</p>

        <h3>The violin</h3>
              <p>When I was seven years old, we received a letter in the mail from Kulturskolan asking us if we wanted to try out an instrument. So, that fall we went to the school to try out instruments. My sister and I tried out all the instruments but the one I though was most fun was the violin. Since then I have played for eight and a half years and really enjoy it. It has taught me to perservere, practice and have patience. Learning to play an instrument can be helpful in these ways since you have to practice to gain skills. Many people quit as a kid and then regret it by the time they grow up. I am glad I decided to continue.</p>
